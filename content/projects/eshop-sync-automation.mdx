> Automated daily sync between WooCommerce and Shopify with custom mapping, safe updates, and cleanup.

![Sync flow](/projects/eshop-sync-automation/flow.png "High-level sync flow")

## Overview
A robust, idempotent pipeline that **reads WooCommerce** products, **maps** them to Shopify schema, and **performs full sync**:
- **Create** missing products
- **Update** changed products
- **Delete** products removed/disabled at the source (configurable)

Runs on a **daily schedule** (cron/Docker) with **audit logs** and retry logic.

## Key Capabilities
- **Custom mapping**: categories → `product_type` & tags; brand → vendor; attributes → variants/options; images normalization.
- **SKU as source of truth** for lookup & updates.
- **Safe cleanup**: optional vendor filter + dry-run before deletions.
- **Rate-limit aware**: backoff & batching for Shopify API.

## Mapping Rules (example)
- `category_path` → first node as `product_type`, rest as `tags`
- `manufacturer` → `vendor`
- Stock flags → publish status & inventory quantities
- HTML descriptions → sanitized / plain-text fallback

## Schedule & Deployment
- Dockerized job with `.env` configuration
- Runnable via **cron**, **GitHub Actions**, or a server scheduler

**Result:** Consistent Shopify catalog, **always aligned** with WooCommerce—no duplicates, no stale items.
